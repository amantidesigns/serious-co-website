# Typography Widow & Text Flow Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive typography improvements made to prevent widows (single words left alone on a line) and improve text flow across all breakpoints on the website.

## Modern CSS Solutions Implemented

### 1. Global CSS Text-Wrap Properties (`src/app/globals.css`)

Added modern CSS text-wrap properties that work across all browsers:

```css
/* Applied to all headings */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}

/* Applied to all paragraphs */
p {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- `text-wrap: balance` - Distributes text evenly across lines for headings, preventing awkward line breaks
- `text-wrap: pretty` - Automatically prevents orphans and widows in body text (experimental but well-supported)

### 2. Utility Classes Added

New utility classes for developers to use throughout the site:

```css
.text-wrap-balance { text-wrap: balance; }
.text-wrap-pretty { text-wrap: pretty; }
.text-wrap-stable { text-wrap: stable; }
.no-widows { text-wrap: pretty; }
.keep-together { white-space: nowrap; }
```

## Specific Widow Fixes by Page

### Work Page (`src/app/work/CaseStudiesClient.tsx`)
**Issue:** The word "every" was orphaned on its own line in the hero paragraph

**Fix:**
```tsx
// Before: "...we bring thoughtful strategy and craft to every project."
// After: "...we bring thoughtful strategy and craft to every project."
```
Added `&nbsp;` between "to", "every", and "project" to keep the last few words together.

### Why Us Page (`src/app/why-us/page.tsx`)
Applied non-breaking spaces to prevent widows in:
- Hero paragraph: "Layers when you need direct answers."
- Empathy section: "You need someone who understands what you're trying to solve, then solves it."
- Process descriptions for all three steps
- Outcome descriptions
- Success section: "Real work that solves your real problem."
- CTA section: "We'll tell you if we can help."

### Services Page (`src/app/services/page.tsx`)
Fixed widows in:
- Hero subheading: "Premium creative work in days, not months."
- All 12 service descriptions (e.g., "Strategic creative solutions that communicate your message clearly and effectively.")
- Bottom statement: "Every project is unique, and we approach each one with fresh eyes and clear thinking."

### Case Studies (`src/lib/content/caseStudies.ts`)
Fixed widows in case study descriptions:
- Jayded AF: "...cocktail enthusiasts and luxury consumers."
- HealThrive Recovery: "...find the resources they need."

### AI Training Page (`src/app/ai-training/page.tsx`)
Fixed widows in:
- Hero heading: "Learn AI in three days."
- Hero description: "We'll teach you what matters and skip the rest."

### Footer (`src/components/FooterSection.tsx`)
Fixed widow in:
- Company description: "...graphics, and videos using next-gen AI."

## Browser Support

### Modern CSS Properties
- **text-wrap: balance** - Supported in Chrome 114+, Edge 114+, Safari 17.5+
- **text-wrap: pretty** - Supported in Chrome 117+, Edge 117+, Safari 17.5+, Firefox Nightly

### Fallback Strategy
- Older browsers will gracefully degrade to standard text wrapping
- Non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) provide universal support across all browsers
- The combination ensures optimal results in modern browsers with fallback support

## Best Practices Going Forward

### When to Use Non-Breaking Spaces (`&nbsp;`)
1. **Critical phrases** that should never break (e.g., "next-gen AI")
2. **Last 2-3 words** of important paragraphs to prevent widows
3. **Numbers with units** (e.g., "3 days", "$200")
4. **Titles and proper nouns** that lose meaning when split

### When to Use CSS Classes
1. **Headings** - Already have `text-wrap: balance` globally
2. **Paragraphs** - Already have `text-wrap: pretty` globally
3. **Specific elements** - Use `.no-widows` or `.keep-together` classes as needed

### Testing at Different Breakpoints
Always test text flow at these key breakpoints:
- Mobile (320px-640px)
- Tablet (641px-1024px)
- Desktop (1025px-1440px)
- Large desktop (1441px+)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Responsive Considerations
- Used conditional rendering for mobile vs desktop in some places (e.g., Work page)
- Strategic use of `<span className="hidden md:inline">` to control text flow
- Non-breaking spaces work at all breakpoints

### Performance Impact
- CSS text-wrap properties have **zero performance impact**
- Non-breaking spaces add minimal HTML size (1 extra entity per use)
- No JavaScript required - pure CSS solution

## Examples of Improvements

### Before:
```
We bring thoughtful strategy and craft to
every
project.
```

### After:
```
We bring thoughtful strategy and craft
to every project.
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitor browser support** - As text-wrap properties gain wider support, some manual `&nbsp;` fixes can be removed
2. **Test on real devices** - Different screen sizes may reveal new widow issues
3. **Content guidelines** - Educate content creators about widow prevention when writing copy
4. **Automated testing** - Consider adding visual regression tests for typography at key breakpoints
