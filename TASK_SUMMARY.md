Compared all three pages for consistency:

## 🎨 Design Pattern

All three pages now follow this structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     EYEBROW (uppercase, small)      │
│                                     │
│     MAIN HEADING                    │
│     (Large, light weight)           │
│                                     │
│     Descriptive paragraph text      │
│     (Medium, 80% opacity)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
      Centered, max-width 56rem
```

## 💡 Key Improvements

2. **Better Context**: Expanded paragraph explains company approach
3. **Visual Consistency**: All major pages now have unified appearance
