## ✨ What Was Implemented

### 1. **CTA Section Component** (`CaseStudyCTA.tsx`)

A new component with **prioritized call-to-action options** designed to draw maximum attention to the Google Calendar booking option.

#### Features:
- **Primary CTA**: Google Calendar booking (white gradient button with maximum visibility)
- **Secondary CTA**: Direct phone call to (952) 215-7878 (prominent border button)
- **Tertiary CTA**: Email contact (subtle border option)
- Responsive design (stacks on mobile, horizontal on desktop)
- Smooth animations on scroll
- Includes eyebrow label, descriptive heading, and response time promise

#### Design Priorities:
```
[Book Discovery Call] ← Brightest, most prominent
[Call (952) 215-7878]  ← Secondary emphasis
[Send Email]           ← Tertiary option
```

### 2. **Related Services Component** (`CaseStudyRelatedServices.tsx`)

A new component that displays services used and team members involved in the case study.

#### Features:
- Auto-generates links to service pages
- Links to individual team member profiles
- Two-column grid layout (responsive to single column on mobile)
- Hover effects on all tags
- Cross-linking improves SEO and site navigation
- Increases time on site by encouraging exploration

#### Two Sections:
1. **Services Used** - Links to relevant service pages
2. **Team Members** - Links to individual team member profiles

### 3. **Improved Layout & Spacing**

Updated both case study pages (HealThrive Recovery and Jayded AF) with:

#### Spacing Improvements:
- **Top-level container**: Uses `space-y-32` for consistent 32-unit spacing between major sections
- **Metadata section**: Larger gaps between items (12 units instead of 6)
- **Font sizes**: Increased metadata value font sizes for better hierarchy
- **Visual dividers**: Added border-top separators between sections with proper padding (pt-16)
- **Consistent with newer pages**: Matches spacing patterns from Why Us and Team pages

#### Layout Changes:
- Removed cramped `theme.spacing` utility overrides
- Used Tailwind's natural spacing scale for better consistency
- Added section comments for clarity
- Better visual hierarchy with improved typography sizes
