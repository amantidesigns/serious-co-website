## 🎯 What Was Changed

### The Problem
The old Why Us page featured:
- ❌ Interactive auto-cycling tabs that required user engagement
- ❌ Team section buried at the very bottom
- ❌ No context for why the team matters
- ❌ Some conceptual repetition
- ❌ Complex state management for animation

### The Solution
The new Why Us page now features:
- ✅ Clear linear narrative (Problem → Philosophy → Process → Promise → People → Action)
- ✅ Team section integrated meaningfully with context frames
- ✅ Scroll-triggered animations (performant, no required interaction)
- ✅ Reinforced brand voice throughout (direct, no jargon, punchy)
- ✅ Strong closing CTA with clear action options
- ✅ Fully responsive design across all devices

## 🎨 Brand Voice Application

Every section follows A Very Serious Company's brand principles:

### ✓ What We Do Right
- **Direct & Honest**: "Most agencies overcomplicate everything."
- **No Jargon**: "We dig in" not "we leverage solutions"
- **Concrete Specifics**: "No shortcuts. No bloat." not "optimal results"
- **Short Sentences**: Average 8-15 words
- **Active Voice**: "We understand" not "It is understood"
- **Confident but Humble**: "Something that works" not "best-in-class excellence"

### Examples Throughout Page
```
Hero: "Most agencies overcomplicate everything. Or miss the point entirely."
Process: "Not what's trendy. Not what's flashy. What *matters*."
Promise: "Not to add complexity. To cut through it."
CTA: "Let's talk. We'll understand what you need, figure out what matters."
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 640px)
- Single column layout
- Text scales down appropriately
- Buttons stack vertically
- Full-width team cards

### Tablet (640px - 1024px)
- 2-3 column grids where appropriate
- Balanced spacing and readability
- Buttons remain responsive

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Full 3-4 column grids
- Maximum content width (1152px)
- Generous padding and spacing
- Optimal reading line length

---

## 🎬 Animation Strategy

### Page Load (Hero)
```tsx
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.8, delay: 0.3 }}
```
- Hero section fades in and slides up on page load
- Creates visual impact without being jarring

### Scroll Reveal (All Other Sections)
```tsx
whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }}
viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-100px" }}
```
- Sections fade in as user scrolls to them
- Triggers 100px before section enters viewport
- Plays only once (performance optimization)

### Staggered Children (Process Section)
```tsx
delay: index * 0.15  // 150ms between each step
```
- Step 1, 2, 3 animate in sequence
- Creates visual flow and rhythm
