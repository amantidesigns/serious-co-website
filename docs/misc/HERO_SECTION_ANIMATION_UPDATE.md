# Hero Section: Scroll-Driven Animation Update

## 🎬 What Changed: The Animated Problem Visualizer

The hero section has been transformed from static text to an **interactive, scroll-driven animation** that visually demonstrates the agency problem.

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Scroll-Driven Animation (NOT Page Load)
- Uses Framer Motion's `useScroll()` and `useTransform()` hooks
- Animation is **controlled by scroll position**, not time
- Scroll down → animation plays forward
- Scroll back up → animation reverses
- Creates a "scrubbing" effect where you control the animation playhead

### Three Conflict Pairs

**Pair 1: Speed vs Craft**
- ⚡ Speed (red) flies in from left
- 🎨 Craft (blue) flies in from right
- Collision at center with particle burst

**Pair 2: Process vs Results**
- 📋 Process (orange) flies in from left
- 🎯 Results (purple) flies in from right
- Collision at center with particle burst

**Pair 3: Vision vs Execution**
- 💭 Vision (pink) flies in from left
- ⚙️ Execution (green) flies in from right
- Collision at center with particle burst

### Animation Timeline

```
Scroll Position: 0% ─────────────────────── 30% ──────── 35%
                 │                          │          │
Elements:        [Left: -500px]             [0px]      [particle burst]
                 [Right: 500px]             [0px]      [burst scale 1]

Text Overlay:    [Fully visible]            [Fading out]
                 opacity: 1                 opacity: 0.3
```

## 🎨 Visual Elements

### Colored Boxes (24x24 pixels each)
Each box is 24 pixels (w-24, h-24) with:
- Icon and label inside
- Rounded corners (rounded-lg)
- Gradient background (to-left or to-right)
- Shadow effect (shadow-lg)
- Smooth translation from edge to center

### Collision Particles
When boxes collide at center:
- 8 particles emanate from collision point
- Each particle flies outward at 45° angles (Math.cos/sin)
- Particles fade out during burst
- Creates "shattering" effect

### Text Overlay
- Appears at bottom of container
- Fades in/out with scroll progress
- Provides context: "Most agencies make you choose"
- Includes call-to-action: "Scroll to see the solution"

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Hooks Used
```typescript
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
  target: containerRef,
  offset: ["start start", "end center"]
});
```
- Tracks scroll position within the container
- From: top of container
- To: center of viewport

### Animation Transforms
```typescript
const leftX = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.3], [-500, 0]);
const rightX = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.3], [500, 0]);
```
- Maps scroll 0% → 30% to movement -500px → 0px (and +500px → 0px)
- After 30%, elements stay at center
- Before 30%, elements fly in from edges

### Particle Effects
```typescript
const particleOpacity = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0.25, 0.35], [0, 1]);
const particleScale = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0.25, 0.35], [0, 1]);
```
- Particles only appear during collision window (25% → 35%)
- Opacity and scale go from 0 to 1
- Creates "burst" effect on impact

## 📐 Container Setup

### Container Dimensions
```tsx
<div 
  ref={containerRef}
  className="relative min-h-[120vh] flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden pt-20"
>
```
- Height: 120vh (takes up full screen + extra for scroll animation)
- Overflow: hidden (particles stay within bounds)
- Padding-top: 5 rem for navbar space

### Animation Area
```tsx
<div className="relative w-full max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 h-96 flex items-center justify-center">
```
- Fixed height: 24 rem (h-96)
- Centered horizontally
- Contains all three collision pairs

---

## 🎯 Three Pair Layout

Each pair is structured as:
```tsx
<div className="relative w-full h-24 flex items-center justify-center">
  <motion.div style={{ x: leftX }} className="absolute left-0 ...">
    Left element
  </motion.div>
  
  <div className="absolute z-10 text-white/30">VS</div>
  
  <motion.div style={{ x: rightX }} className="absolute right-0 ...">
    Right element
  </motion.div>
  
  <motion.div style={{ opacity: particleOpacity, scale: particleScale }}>
    [8 particle dots]
  </motion.div>
</div>
```

- Pair height: 6 rem (h-24)
- Gap between pairs: 4 rem (gap-16)
- Each element is absolutely positioned
- Particles overlay the entire pair

## 🌈 Color Scheme

| Concept | Color | Gradient |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Speed | Red | from-red-500 to-red-400 |
| Craft | Blue | from-blue-500 to-blue-400 |
| Process | Orange | from-orange-500 to-orange-400 |
| Results | Purple | from-purple-500 to-purple-400 |
| Vision | Pink | from-pink-500 to-pink-400 |
| Execution | Green | from-green-500 to-green-400 |

Each uses Tailwind colors with gradient direction based on left/right positioning.

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 640px)
- All elements scale appropriately
- Boxes remain visible and collide
- Animation still works smoothly
- Text adapts: "Most agencies make you choose"

### Tablet (640px - 1024px)
- Animation area expands
- Boxes have more room to travel
- Still fully functional

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Full animation with max travel distance (500px ←→ 0px)
- Optimal visibility and impact
- Smooth particle burst effect

---

## 🎮 User Interaction

### Scroll Down
1. User scrolls down on page load
2. Red box flies in from left
3. Blue box flies in from right
4. At scroll ~30%, they meet at center
5. Collision detected
6. 8 white particles burst outward and fade
7. Text fades out gradually

### Scroll Back Up
1. User scrolls back up
2. Animation reverses in perfect reverse:
3. Particles disappear
4. Boxes fly back out to edges (left ← left, right → right)
5. Text fades back in
6. Back to starting position

### All Three Pairs Sync
- All three pairs animate in perfect sync
- Scroll controls all simultaneously
- No delay between them

## ✨ Why This Works Better

### Demonstrates the Problem Visually
Instead of *telling* visitors there's a conflict, you're *showing* them:
- Speed and Craft can't coexist (they crash)
- Process and Results conflict (they break)
- Vision and Execution don't align (they collide)

### Engagement Through Interaction
- User scrolls to see the animation
- Creates muscle memory (scroll = see more)
- Feels responsive and interactive
- Builds anticipation for "the solution"

### Memorable Visual
- Colorful boxes, particle effects
- Smooth animations
- Visual metaphor is clear
- Stays in mind after page leaves

### Perfect Setup for Next Section
- Hero shows the PROBLEM (animated conflict)
- Next section shows the SOLUTION (Charlie Munger quote)
- Then comparison showing HOW we solve it
- Creates narrative flow

---

## 🔄 Animation States

### Initial State (Page Load)
- Boxes positioned far off-screen (-500px, +500px)
- Particles opacity: 0
- Text opacity: 1 (fully visible)

### Mid Scroll (0% → 30%)
- Boxes animating toward center
- Particles still hidden
- Text visible but opacity dropping gradually

### Collision (30% → 35%)
- Boxes at center (x: 0)
- Particles burst outward (opacity/scale: 0 → 1)
- Text mostly faded

### Post-Collision (35% → End)
- Boxes hold at center
- Particles fade out
- Text nearly invisible

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Adjust Animation Timing
```typescript
// Faster collision
const leftX = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.2], [-500, 0]);

// Slower collision
const leftX = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.4], [-500, 0]);
```

### Change Particle Count
```typescript
{[...Array(12)].map((_, i) => ( // 12 particles instead of 8
```

### Adjust Travel Distance
```typescript
const leftX = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.3], [-300, 0]); // 300px instead of 500px
```

### Change Particle Spread
```typescript
x: Math.cos(i * Math.PI / 4) * 120,  // 120px radius instead of 80px
```

## 🎬 Technical Stack

- **Framer Motion**: `useScroll()`, `useTransform()`, `motion.div`
- **React**: `useRef()` for container tracking
- **Tailwind CSS**: Colors, sizing, positioning
- **Math**: Math.cos/sin for circular particle distribution
