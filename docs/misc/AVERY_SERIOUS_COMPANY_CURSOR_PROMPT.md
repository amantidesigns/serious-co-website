- **Clear thinking applied consistently** - No elaborate processes, just straightforward execution
- **Honest, direct communication** - No marketing fluff or buzzwords
- **Quality over complexity** - High craft delivered simply

### Writing Style Guidelines

#### Tone
- **Minimalist and direct** - Say exactly what needs to be said, nothing more
- **Confident but not arrogant** - We know our value without overselling
- **Honest and transparent** - Straight answers to straight questions
- **Sophisticated simplicity** - Premium quality expressed simply

#### Voice Characteristics

- **Short, punchy sentences** - Each sentence should have purpose
- **Conversational but professional** - Like talking to a smart friend
- **Understated confidence** - Let the work speak for itself

#### Language Patterns
- Use **simple, clear language** - Complex ideas expressed simply
- **Active voice** - "We create" not "We are creating"
- **Concrete specifics** - "3 weeks" not "quick turnaround"
- **Emphasis through italics** - *seriously* for key concepts
- **Direct questions and answers** - Address what people actually ask

### Content Structure

#### Headlines & Titles
- **Direct and descriptive** - "Our Approach" not "How We Work"
- **Benefit-focused** - What the reader gets, not what we do
- **Simple language** - Avoid clever wordplay or puns

#### Body Copy
- **Paragraph structure**: One idea per paragraph, 2-4 sentences max
- **Lead with the point** - Don't bury the lede
- **Use examples** - "Take this website: we identified what visitors need to know, then said exactly that"
- **End with action** - Clear next steps or conclusions

#### FAQ Style
- **Question format**: "People ask us..." or "They want to know..."
- **Direct answers** - No hedging or corporate speak
- **Honest about limitations** - "Depends on what you need" is better than false promises

### Key Messaging Themes

- **We don't limit ourselves to categories**

### Writing Examples

#### Good Examples
- "We take simple ideas *seriously.*"
- "The best process is no process at all—just clear thinking applied consistently."
- "Depends on what you need. We'll give you a straight answer after we understand your project."
- "As long as it takes to do it right. We don't pad timelines, but we don't rush good work either."

#### Avoid These
- "We leverage cutting-edge solutions to disrupt the market"
- "Our proprietary methodology ensures optimal outcomes"
- "We're passionate about delivering exceptional results"
- "Let's synergize to create impactful experiences"

### Content Categories

#### Service Descriptions
- **What we actually do** - Websites, graphics, videos
- **How we do it** - Using AI, clear thinking, consistent execution
- **What makes it different** - No process, just results

#### Case Studies
- **Project context** - What the client needed
- **Our approach** - How we solved it simply
- **Results** - What we delivered
- **Tech stack** - Tools used (Figma, Webflow, AI, etc.)

#### Blog Posts
- **Topics** - Design, technology, AI, strategy, process, industry takes
- **Perspective** - Studio opinions and real experience, not generic advice
- **Structure** - Open with the point, build with specifics, close with something that sticks
- **Length** - 500–1,200 words. Enough to say something real. Not so long it becomes a white paper.
- **Openings** - Start with a claim, observation, or insight. Never "In today's fast-paced world..." or any variation.
- **Endings** - Tie back to AVSC's philosophy when natural. End on a line that lands. The last sentence should feel intentional.
- **Humor** - Dry and understated. We're funny because we're honest, not because we're performing.
- **Hot takes** - Welcome and encouraged. Back them up with reasoning or experience. Opinions without substance are noise.
- **Self-reference** - Reference our work, process, or studio when it serves the reader. Not self-promotion for its own sake.
- **Technical content** - Explain clearly. No gatekeeping. If a non-technical reader can't follow, simplify further.

#### About Us Content
- **Philosophy** - Charlie Munger quote and our interpretation
- **Approach** - Clear thinking applied consistently
- **Values** - Taking simple ideas seriously

#### Social Media (Twitter)
- **Same voice, tighter.** Every word earns its place.
- **Lead with the idea.** Never "New blog post!" — start with the insight.
- **Thread format** - 2-3 tweets. Hook, substance, link.
- **No hashtag spam.** One or two, or none.
- **No emoji unless it adds meaning.**
- **Reads like a person sharing something interesting, not a brand broadcasting.**

### Technical Writing Notes

- **User-focused content** - Write for people, not search engines
- **Clear structure** - Use headings that make sense

#### Accessibility
- **Plain language** - Avoid jargon and complex terms
