## Design & UX

### Navigation Card Styling
- **Border:** `border-white/10` with hover state `border-white/30`
- **Background:** Transparent with hover state `bg-white/5`
- **Transition:** Smooth 300ms duration
- **Grid:** Responsive 1 column (mobile) → 2 columns (desktop)
- **Gap:** 8px (2rem) between items

### Back Button Styling
- **Text:** `text-white/70` with hover state `text-white`
- **Icon:** Arrow left (←) with inline gap
- **Transition:** Color changes on hover
- **Position:** Top of detail section after media

### Arrow Indicators
- **Direction:** Previous (←) on left, Next (→) on right
- **Style:** Light arrow in placeholder box (`bg-white/5`)
- **Text Color:** `text-white/40` for subtle appearance

## Performance

- **Build Time:** 3 seconds
- **Pages Generated:** 25 total (6 service pages are SSG)
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage
- **Bundle Size:** Minimal increase (~5KB)
- **SEO:** Metadata on all pages with `generateMetadata()`

## Static Generation

Service pages are pre-rendered at build time using `generateStaticParams()`:

```typescript
export function generateStaticParams() {
  return services.map((service) => ({
    slug: service.slug,
  }));
}
```

This ensures:
- Fast page loads (no runtime generation)
- Better SEO (static HTML)
- Reduced server load
- Consistent performance

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- [ ] Service pricing pages
- [ ] Service booking/inquiry forms
- [ ] Case study filtering by category
- [ ] Related services recommendation
- [ ] Service comparison tool
- [ ] Client testimonials on service pages
- [ ] Service bundling/packages
