# Why Us Page V3 - Before & After Comparison

## Problem Statement

**User Feedback:**
> "The page is also a little long. I really have to scroll a lot to get all this content. Do not use cheap emojis, they look ugly. Please do not use emojis. Remember to use and respect the aesthetics of the site. Rethink the hero header section. I don't like this approach at all. Maybe just use a creative typography aesthetic with large text. And then some kind of cool shattering effect."
