## 📖 StoryBrand Framework Structure

### 1. **THE PROBLEM** (Hero's Challenge)
**Section:** Hero
**Message:** "You have a problem. Most agencies make it worse."

**Interactive Elements:**
- Animated stat cards with hover states
- Progress bars showing problem severity
- Icon-based visual hierarchy
- Real percentages (87%, 72%, 91%)

**Copy Strategy:**
- Direct, confrontational
- Identifies customer pain
- Sets up the stakes immediately

---

### 2. **THE GUIDE** (Empathy + Authority)
**Section:** "We understand"
**Message:** "We've seen this before. It doesn't have to be this way."

**Interactive Elements:**
- **3-tab system** (Speed, Clarity, Craft)
- Authority metric cards (48hr, Zero BS, 100%)
- Animated tab content transitions
- Skill level progress bars

**Copy Strategy:**
- Empathy: "We understand your frustration"
- Authority: Real metrics, real proof
- No jargon comparison (what you won't vs will hear)

---

### 3. **THE PLAN** (3 Simple Steps)
**Section:** "How it works"
**Message:** "Three steps. That's it."

**Interactive Elements:**
- **Accordion component** for each step
- Large step numbers (01, 02, 03)
- Expandable detailed descriptions
- Clear outcome boxes with checkmarks

**Copy Strategy:**
- Ultra-simple 3-step process
- Each step = clarity on what happens
- Outcome-focused (what they get)

**The Plan:**
1. **You tell us the problem** → Clarity on success
2. **We figure out what matters** → A plan that makes sense
3. **We build it right** → Something that works

---

### 4. **THE STAKES** (Success vs Failure)

**Message:** "The cost of choosing wrong."

- Hover effects on comparison cards
- Impact labels

**Copy Strategy:**
- Direct comparison format
- Shows consequences of wrong choice
- Highlights benefits of right choice

**Comparisons:**
- Months of meetings ❌ → Clear answers in days ✅
- Layers of approval ❌ → Direct access ✅
- Generic templates ❌ → Custom solutions ✅

**Section:** "What you get"
**Message:** "Work that actually works."

**Interactive Elements:**

- Hover lift effect (y: -8)

**Success Outcomes:**

---
