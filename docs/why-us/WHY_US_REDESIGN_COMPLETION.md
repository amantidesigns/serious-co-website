   ├─ Root principle from authority figure
   └─ Connect wisdom to practice

3. PROCESS: Three-Part System
   ├─ 01 UNDERSTAND: What actually matters
   ├─ 02 EXECUTE: Do it properly
   └─ 03 DELIVER: Something that works

4. PROMISE: Core Commitment
   ├─ "Clear thinking applied consistently"
   └─ Highlight our mission

   ├─ 4 team members displayed
   └─ Real faces build trust

6. TEAM CONTEXT: Why They Matter

## 🎨 Design Decisions Made

### What We Changed
- ❌ **Removed**: Auto-cycling tabs with progress indicators
- ❌ **Removed**: Complex state management (useState + useEffect)
- ❌ **Removed**: "Hover to pause" experience (mobile-hostile)
- ✅ **Added**: Clear narrative structure
- ✅ **Added**: Pre/post team context sections
- ✅ **Added**: Strong closing CTA
- ✅ **Added**: Performance-optimized scroll triggers

### Why Each Decision
1. **Narrative > Interaction**: Users scroll naturally, no required actions
2. **Team Integration**: People make sense after philosophy established
3. **CTA Placement**: After team builds personal connection before asking
4. **Animation**: Scroll-triggered with `once: true` for performance
5. **Brand Voice**: Every word vetted against brand guidelines

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 640px)
```
[Hero text - scales down]
[Philosophy - single column]
[Process - stacked 1 col]
[Promise - full width]
[Team - 1 col stacked]
[Context - full width]
[CTA - buttons stacked]
```

### Tablet (640px - 1024px)
```
[Hero text - medium]
[Philosophy - centered]
[Process - 2-3 columns]
[Promise - full width]
[Team - 2 columns]
[Context - full width]
[CTA - buttons side-by-side]
```

### Desktop (> 1024px)
```
[Hero text - large]
[Philosophy - centered]
[Process - 3 columns]
[Promise - full width]
[Team - 4 columns]
[Context - full width]
[CTA - buttons side-by-side]
```
