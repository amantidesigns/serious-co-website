# Work Pages Layout Review & Fixes

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Issue #1: Duplicate Page Headers (FIXED)
**Problem:** Both `ContentPageLayout` title prop AND `CaseStudyHeroHeader` component were rendering headers, creating redundancy.
- Old: `<ContentPageLayout title="Case Studies / HealThrive Recovery" centerTitle={false}>`
- New: `<ContentPageLayout centerTitle={false}>`

**Impact:** Eliminates visual clutter and follows DRY principle.

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/app/work/healthrive-recovery/page.tsx`
- `src/app/work/jayded-af/page.tsx`

---

### ✅ Issue #2: Inconsistent Spacing (FIXED)
**Problem:** Spacing tokens were inconsistent across the page structure.
- Changed `theme.spacing.gap.md` → `theme.spacing.gap.lg` (metadata grid)
- Changed `theme.spacing.space.lg` → `theme.spacing.space.xl` (main wrapper)
- Changed `theme.spacing.space.md` → `theme.spacing.space.xl` (tech stack)
- Added `mt-16` to first content div for breathing room after hero

**Impact:** Better visual hierarchy and consistency with website design system.

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/app/work/healthrive-recovery/page.tsx`
- `src/app/work/jayded-af/page.tsx`

---

### ✅ Issue #3: Team Member Display (FIXED)
**Problem:** Team members were just text ("Amanti & Robera"), not interactive.
- Old: `<div>Amanti & Robera</div>`
- New: Individual clickable team member cards with photos and links to profiles

**Implementation:**
- Links to team member profiles (`/team/[slug]`)
- Team member photos with proper Image component
- Styled as rounded pill buttons with hover effects
- Responsive and accessible

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/app/work/healthrive-recovery/page.tsx`
- `src/app/work/jayded-af/page.tsx`

---

### ✅ Issue #4: Tech Stack Tags (FIXED)
**Problem:** Web Design and Web Development tags weren't clickable links to services.
- Old: `<ProjectTag variant="work-type">Web Design</ProjectTag>`
- New: `<Link href="/services/web-design"><ProjectTag variant="work-type">Web Design</ProjectTag></Link>`

**Impact:** Improves navigation and connects users to related service pages.

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/app/work/healthrive-recovery/page.tsx`
- `src/app/work/jayded-af/page.tsx`

---

### ✅ Issue #5: Import Organization (FIXED)
**Problem:** Imports were scattered throughout the file (before and after metadata).
- Reorganized all imports to the top of the file
- Proper order: Next.js modules, then local components, then utilities

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/app/work/healthrive-recovery/page.tsx`
- `src/app/work/jayded-af/page.tsx`

## Current Layout Structure (Both Pages)

All work/case study pages now follow this consistent structure:

```
<ContentPageLayout centerTitle={false}>
  <div> {/* Main wrapper with theme spacing */}
    
    <CaseStudyHeroHeader /> {/* Handles heading + intro description */}
    
    <div> {/* Content wrapper with spacing */}
      
      <div> {/* Detailed description paragraph */}
      
      <div> {/* Metadata grid: Turnaround, Client source, Design team */}
      
      <div> {/* Tech Stack row */}
      
    </div>
    
    <div> {/* Project media: image or video */}
    
    <CaseStudyNavigation /> {/* Previous/Next case study nav */}
    
    <CaseStudyCTA /> {/* Call-to-action section */}
    
    <Link> {/* Back to Our Work link */}
    
  </div>
</ContentPageLayout>
```

✅ Consistent color scheme and typography

### Between Pages
✅ Both HealThrive Recovery and Jayded AF pages now have identical structure
✅ Same spacing patterns and responsive behavior
✅ Same component composition and hierarchy
✅ Consistent team member display format
✅ Consistent tech stack presentation
